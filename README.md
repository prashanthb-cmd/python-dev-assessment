##### Python Developer Assessment

##### This repository is for my developer assessment task





In this Python developer exercise, I worked through a complete set of concepts ranging from the basics to advanced topics. The project began with setting up the Python environment in VS Code and running a simple program by printing "Hello Developer!". I also learned the importance of GitHub and applied various Git commands throughout the project to manage versions effectively.



To maintain clean and consistent code, I used formatting and linting tools such as Black and Flake8. I strengthened my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms and then applied core Python concepts through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating and working with classes and objects.



I also practiced handling runtime errors using exception-handling mechanisms like try, except, and finally.

The final and most interesting part of the project involved making HTTP requests to a REST API and processing JSON responses using Python’s requests library.



Tasks Completed

* 
* Basic Python program
* 
* Working with GitHub commands (branch, add, commit, push)
* 
* Code style and linting (Black, Flake8)
* 
* Data structure \& algorithm challenges
* 
* Implemented a Book class (OOPs concept)
* 
* Debugging and error handling
* 
* Fetching and processing API data from JSON Placeholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)



Reflection



The most interesting and challenging part of this project was working with API interaction in Python, which was completely new to me. I learned how HTTP requests work under the hood and how to fetch, parse, and process JSON data using Python. This gave me a deeper understanding of how backend systems communicate with external services.
